Codes used for the publication: "Polyampholyte model of ion clusters: double-layer interactions in the presence of dissociated simple salt"
In the directory "alternating charges", the Fortran code "y2w_sigc_2pelmonoval_finw_xsalt.f" manages monodisperse polyampholytes + simple salt. In the directory "charged blocks" you will find a similar code for polyampholytes composed of two blocks with charged monomers (the overall polymers being monovalent).
